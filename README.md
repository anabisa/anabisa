### Hi! anabisa means i can
"Anabisa" is my GitHub username, which translates to "I Can" in Arabic. This name embodies my belief that with coding skills, I can unlock a myriad of opportunities, including the chance to work at leading tech companies like FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google). This username is more than just a moniker; it's a philosophy that drives me to continuously learn and grow in the field of technology. With hard work, dedication, and ongoing education, I am confident that "Anabisa" is not just a slogan, but a reality that I can achieve.
